When I click on login/signup page I am directed to a login form, if user doesnâ€™t have a user login, they will create one.

Once the user logs in they will be directed to a member specific view which displays a create list form, lists that have been made, a suggestion of 25 gifts.

###

When the user selects a list from the left, the list shows on the right side of the screen. User is able to add more items to their list. User can also refresh and get 25 new items to select from. Christmas music also plays in the background. 
User is able to delete lists when finished. 




### USER STORY: As a family member/friend I would like to be able to create lists online so that I am able to stay organized. I would like to see suggested gifts and be able to click on them to add to a list. I would like to be able to see photos and a URL link that takes me to Etsy where there is a description of the item. This will make my holiday shopping much easier.
